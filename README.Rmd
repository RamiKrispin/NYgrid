ðŸš§ WIP ðŸš§

The NYgrid R package provides access to a set of high-frequency (hourly) time series dataset, describing the demand generation of electricity by the New York Independent System Operator. 

Data source: [EIA API](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/)

The package goals:

- Supporting material for the Applied Time Series Analysis and Forecasting book.
- Example for setting live data automation with R, Github Actions, and Docker

## Installation

You can install the development version of NYgrid from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RamiKrispin/NYgrid")
```

## Data 

The electricity demand generation dataset includes eleven time series, each representing a New York Independent System Operator region. 

```{r example}
library(NYgrid)
```

TODO

- Add data dictionary
- Simple example
- Data architecture
